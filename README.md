### Hi there, I'm Vern Chien Chao! 👋
💻 I am a Full stack developer. I have a passion for using my knowledge for my career and my hobbies!

✂️ [cutabove](https://pacific-sea-61217.herokuapp.com/#/) is an app created for salons, barbers and freelancers that can easily get bookings, reviews and displayed. It is intended to be exclusive for people all around the US to book appointments for haircuts, hairstyles, or whatever they would like to get done.

🌀 [Echo](https://echo-discordclone.herokuapp.com/#/) is my full-stack application of a discord-clone. It has all of the core features that you would expect. Users can create/join servers, create channels and can post messages on channels via live messaging with action cable websockets!

🏃‍♂️ [MazeRunner](https://vernchao91.github.io/Maze_Runner/) was created for my passion for gaming. I made this game as a casual escape the maze gameplay with obstacles to avoid or get through.

🌱 Frameworks that I am currently learning are 🐍 Python, Django, 🔥Firebase and  C++. I'm determined to expand my knowledge constantly.

🖥🖱️🎮🏀🏈⚽ A few things about myself is that I'm very competitive. I love playing games and sports and I also love watching sports and esports. My passion grows from using technology at such a young age! I now love the fact that I can use my knowledge to make my career part of my hobby!
