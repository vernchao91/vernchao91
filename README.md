### Hi there, I'm Vern Chien Chao! 👋
💻 I am a Full Stack developer. I'm using my skills and passion to extend to my career and hobbies!

✂️ [cutabove](https://pacific-sea-61217.herokuapp.com/#/) is an app created for salons, barbers and freelancers that can easily get appointment bookings and reviews. It is intended to be exclusive for people all around the US to book appointments for haircuts, hairstyles, or whatever they would like to get done.

🌀 [Echo](https://echo-discordclone.herokuapp.com/#/) is my full-stack application discord-clone. It has all of the core features that you would expect. Users can create/join servers, create channels and can post messages on channels via live messaging with action cable websockets!

🏃‍♂️ [MazeRunner](https://vernchao91.github.io/Maze_Runner/) was created from my gaming passion. I made this game as a casual escape the maze gameplay with obstacles to avoid or get through.

🌱 Frameworks that I am currently learning are 🐍 Python, Django, 🔥Firebase and  C++. I'm determined to expand my knowledge constantly.

🖥🖱️🎮⚡🏀🏈⚽ A few things about myself is that I'm very competitive. I love playing and watching sports. I also love playing video games and watching competitive esports. My passion for technology grew at an early age! I now love the fact that I can use my knowledge to make my career part of my hobby!
