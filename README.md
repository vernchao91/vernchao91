### Hi there, I'm Vern! 👋
💻 I am a Full Stack developer. I'm using my skills and passion to extend to my career and hobbies!

✂️ [cutabove](https://pacific-sea-61217.herokuapp.com/#/) is a mock app created for salons, barbers and freelancers that can easily get appointment bookings and reviews. It is intended to be exclusive for people all around the US to book appointments for haircuts, hairstyles, or whatever they would like to get done.

🌀 [Echo](https://echo-discordclone.herokuapp.com/#/) is my full-stack application discord-clone. It has all of the core features that you would expect. Users can create/join/leave servers, create/delete/edit channels and can post messages on channels via live messaging with action cable websockets!

🏃‍♂️ [MazeRunner](https://vernchao91.github.io/Maze_Runner/) was created from my gaming passion. This game was made as a typical maze with obstacles to hurdle. Open doors with a switch or key to escape the maze!

🌱 Frameworks that I am currently learning are 🐍 Python, 🧴 Flask, 🔄 Recoil and TypeScript. I'm determined to continuously expand my knowledge.

🖥🖱️🎮⚡🏀🏈⚽ A few things about myself is that I'm very competitive. I love playing and watching sports. I also love playing video games and watching competitive esports. My passion for technology grew at an early age! I now use my love for technology with my career and hobbies!
